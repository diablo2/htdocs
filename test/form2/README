The jquery.Formbuilder plugin is a script that allows you integrate
a jquery and php-based form-creation tool into your application.

Please report all issues, bugs, and feature suggestions
to: https://snowy-evening.com/botsko/jquery-form-builder/

The tool interface is constructed using form data presented in xml format
by the server. The php class assists you with storing the data,
generating the xml, generating the html form, and processing the data.

A demo of this version may be found at http://experiments.botsko.net/tests/formbuilder/

Please feel free to fork the project and provide patches back.
Please let us know how you're using this product!

The source contains all example files, javascripts necessary, php files,
any documentation, and some PHPUnit unit tests for the class.
